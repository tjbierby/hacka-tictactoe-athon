Scope: 
- Make a tic-tac-toe game
  - at least 2 players
  - at least 3x3 board size
  - players alternate in some way or form
  - one player should be able to win (though is not guaranteed)
- Additional requirements:
  - at least 2 board sizes
  - Dynamic win condition generation: no hard-coded if statements or data structures to determine win conditions.  Such structures can be made, but must be made dynamically via code, not hand-coded in the final product.
